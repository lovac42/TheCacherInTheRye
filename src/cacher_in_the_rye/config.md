# The Cacher In The Rye
For Windows only

## cache_size:
This clears the cache every n audio files.  

Set to 0 for unlimited, if you're working with large amounts of audio recordings, etc...  

The bigger the value the better, at the cost of memory and performance.  
A good value is 32, 64, or 128.  


## direct_access_mode:
Modern versions of mplayer seems to have this unicode bug fixed. However I did not test this with other locales, so direct access mode will allow you to test this and report back any issues.
